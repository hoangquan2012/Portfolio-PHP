Children can interact with her, compete with friends, just as excited in the live class. They squealed with joy when they heard the 'ting ting' sound signaling the correct answer. When I first started using it, I couldn't help but feel stupid and unfamiliar. Fortunately, the young and enthusiastic support team is always willing to support me and my parents to make the class go as smoothly as possible!",

Especially, the lecture stock is invested in images and content, easy to edit for immediate use. There is hardly any repository of lecture content that can match the quality of current Edulive. And the effect brought to teachers is much greater than the effort spent in preparing lectures. Through my practical experiences, students are extremely interested in highly interactive intellectual games. Hopefully in the future, Edulive's lecture collection will be more and more rich.",
